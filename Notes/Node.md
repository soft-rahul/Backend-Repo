## As an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, Node is designed to build scalable network applications.

# Understanding Callbacks
### Callbacks are just functions.

## Types of function
### 1. function Declaration
`
    function fnName(para1,para2) {
        // function body
    }
`

### 2. function expression
`
    const fn = function() {

    }

            or

    const fn = () => {
        // body of function
    }
`

### 3. Callback functions
#### Callbacks are just functions passed into other functions as arguments
